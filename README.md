I am learning how to code using GitHub Desktop, Visual Studio Code, Terminal, and more. 

Excited to get keep learning more. 

## What I have learned so far
1. Git Commands
   Very logical and pragmatic. Nothing to be scare of here. Similar to FTP commands.
2. Often less is MORE.
   Recommendation to use ohmyposh was a bust for now. Font dependency on this device is a blocker. Figure it out another time. 
   -- todo: font install
3. I think I like terminal better than desktop.
   The verdict is still out - but it feels familiar to use terminal over desktop even though I use apps and guis alot more these days for most things. Terminal takes me back to the "early days".
